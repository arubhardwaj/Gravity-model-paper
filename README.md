# Gravity model paper
This repository includes codes, written in R, for the paper I wrote in August, 2020. The paper is now a part of the book [Financing for Development 2030 Global Agenda and Post Covid19 Challenges](https://books.google.it/books?id=RKVKEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&dq=aru+bhardwaj+gravity+model+china+and+global+south&source=bl&ots=aMoClj9jdi&sig=ACfU3U3DvL5F3D4vmnLTZEa1P5bLtZKLOA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjwmsLN87D1AhXRSfEDHXupDp8Q6AF6BAglEAM#v=onepage&q=aru%20bhardwaj%20gravity%20model%20china%20and%20global%20south&f=false).

# Files
Priliminary R file includes all the libraries and necessary preliminary codes required to write for preparing the data. 
Regression and gravity model R file has all codes on the panel regressions and gravity models.
Plot R file is of figures I made for visualizing. They are mentioned in my paper, though image file is not available here.

# Data
It also includes 2 data files, I scaped from various sources for my analysis. Most data is extracted from [Trade Map](https://www.trademap.org/). However, data on distance and landlocked countries is taken from other source.

# Gravity model paper
This repository includes codes, from R, for the paper I wrote in August, 2020. The paper can be found on my [website](https://arubhardwaj.github.io/files/JCGS_Paper.pdf).

# Files
Priliminary R file includes all the libraries and necessary preliminary codes required to write for preparing the data. 
Regression and gravity model R file has all codes on the panel regressions and gravity models.
Plot R file is of figures I made for visualizing. They are mentioned in my paper, though image file is not available here.

# Data
It also includes 2 data files, I scaped from various sources for my analysis. Most data is extracted from [Trade Map](https://www.trademap.org/). However, data on distance and landlocked countries is taken from other source.
